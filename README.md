# Neural-network-with-one-hidden-layer-without-builtin-function-using-Python
The only imported module is numpy. This neural network python class has one hidden layer. You can customize number of neurons in hidden layer and number of iterations while creating the object and calling the train function. I have ordered the methods in neuralnetwork class as per the training process - weights and biases initialization, iterations involving forward propagation and backward propagation to correct error. The network is then tested with test_nn in the class
